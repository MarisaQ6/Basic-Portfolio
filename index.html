                    After many years of managing hotels and small business spas in Austin, Texas and Orlando, Florida Marisa decided to go back to school to finsh her Bachelor's of Arts in Humanities and Creative Writing at the prestigious Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida. The stage and performance life while fulfilling can be difficult when managing an office which is when she began to look into Web Design and Coding. Marisa realized quickly that in order to do what she loves, be creative, while also supporting herself she knew she had to make a drastic change and technology seemed to unite her many projects.  Marisa was always working on social media platforms for work (both her performing and management job) but the "why" and "how" made her curious to know more. The UCF Coding Bootcamp was the next stage Marisa wanted to perform on and with that decision, like many choices in her life, she decided to face the fear and take a leap into the future.</p>
